This version builds heavily on 0.0.7. Not much changes. Hopefully the
task switch mechanism will be fixed in this version and paging will
be implemented.


All C-code must be compiled with functions saving the registers they are using
(-fcall-saved-reg option in gcc, or maybe there is a better way).
